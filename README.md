# new-website
New Website or New Website Archive is a full archived collection of all the random HTML sites I created from 2011 (which was when I started making HTML sites, very badly) up until now

I'm not sure how many websites I've created throughout that time but my guess would be a lot. I'm hoping to be able to upload them here (not all because of size limitations and would take forever) but this version is completely different to what I've got on my computer, that and the fact my local directory is like triple the size of what's on here and has about 100x more stuff lol (little exaggeration but you get the point).

As of writing this, I probably won't be doing as many updates as I used to but I will whenever I can either be bothered too or..... well if I can be bothered too because I'm lazy.

 New Website is a collection of sites I made from 2011 to now. I've re-made the repository so I can place all my other sites on here as one.
